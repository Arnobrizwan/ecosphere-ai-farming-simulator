# Quick Start: Training the Disease Detection Model

## Issue Fixed âœ…

The Kaggle API error has been resolved. The training script now:
- Uses the correct `kagglehub` API
- Falls back to `kaggle` API if needed
- Provides better error messages

## Setup Steps

### 1. Update Dependencies

```bash
cd model-training
source venv/bin/activate  # Activate your existing venv
pip install --upgrade kaggle
```

### 2. Verify Kaggle Credentials

Make sure `~/.kaggle/kaggle.json` exists:

```bash
cat ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
```

Should contain:
```json
{
  "username": "your_username",
  "key": "your_api_key"
}
```

If missing, download from: https://www.kaggle.com/settings â†’ API â†’ Create New Token

### 3. Run Training

```bash
python train_disease_model.py
```

## Expected Output

```

## If It Still Fails

### Manual Download Option

1. Download dataset manually:
   - Visit: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease
   - Click "Download" (requires Kaggle login)
   - Extract to: `model-training/dataset/`

2. Update script to use local path:
   ```python
   # In train_disease_model.py, line 58:
   dataset_path = str(SCRIPT_DIR / 'dataset')
   ```

3. Run training again

## Testing the App

Once training completes:

```bash
# Back to project root
cd ..

# Start app
npm start
```

Navigate: Dashboard â†’ ðŸ”¬ Disease Detection â†’ Take/Select Photo â†’ Detect!

## Troubleshooting

**Error: "No module named 'kaggle'"**
```bash
pip install kaggle
```

**Error: "Permission denied"**
```bash
chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
```

**Error: "Out of memory"**
- Reduce `BATCH_SIZE` in script from 32 to 16
- Close other applications

## Quick Test Without Training

If you want to test the UI without training:
1. The app will work with placeholder model
2. Detection will use a fallback MobileNetV2
3. Results may not be accurate but UI will function

Happy training! ðŸŒ±
